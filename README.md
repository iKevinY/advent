## Test Runner

Under the request of the Advent of Code team, puzzle inputs and outputs
are not being committed to this repo. However, I have written a small
test runner for the puzzles.

The runner assumes that the input for year `YYYY`, day `DD` is stored
in `YYYY/inputs/DD.txt`, and that the expected output is present in
`YYYY/outputs/DD.txt`. If both files are present, the file will be
tested against the input; it passes if all lines in the output file
are printed to stdout during the execution of the program.
